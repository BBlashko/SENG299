    Quality Attributes:
        ❑ A quality attribute (QA) is a measurable or testable property of a system that is used to indicate how 
        well the system satisfies the needs of its stakeholders.

    Categories of Requirements:
        \-> Functional Requirements
            ❑ what the SW should do
        \-> Quality requirements
            ❑ Qualifications (eg speed, reliability)
        \-> Constraints:
            ❑ coming from somewhere... Stakesholders, hardware, platforms...
    
    Architecture "Response":
        \-> What is the "response" of architecture to each of these kinds of requirements?
            ❑ Functional Requirements are satisfied by assigning an appropriate sequence of responsibilites
              throughout the design.
            ❑ Quality requirements  are satisfied by the various structures designed into the architecture, 
              and the behaviours and interactions of the elements that populate those structures
            ❑ Constraints are accepted into design decisions and reconciled with other affected design decisions
    
    Functionality:
        ❑ is the ability of the system to do the work for which it was intended
        ❑ of all of the requirements, functionality has the strangest relationship to architecture
        
    Quality Requirements:
        ❑ Pertain to the functions of a system
            ❑ how quickly does the dialog appear?(performance)
            ❑ how often will this function fail? (availability)
            ❑ how easy is it to learn this function? (usability)
            
    3 Problems with Quality Attributes:
        1) testability:
            ❑ many quality attributes are difficult to test
        2) Mapping of concern to quality factor
            ❑ eg: Is a system failure due to a denial-of-service attack an aspect of availability, an aspect
                  of performance, an aspect of security, or an aspect of usability?
        3) vocabulary:
            ❑ Performance community: "failures", usability community: "user input"
            
    2 categories of Quality Attributes:
        ❑ QAs that describe some property of the system at runtime, such as availability,
          performance, or usability
        ❑ QAs that describe some property of the development of the system, such as modifiability or testability
        
    Specifying QA requirements:
        ❑ Stimulus:
        ❑ Stimulus resource:
        ❑ environment:
        ❑ artifact
        ❑ response
        ❑ response measure
